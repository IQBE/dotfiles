# My dotfiles
An easy way for me to store and share my dotfiles for Linux configuration. Complete with custom themes, programs, extensions and an install script to quickly be able to setup a new system.

# Color palette
I added a color palette, heavily inspired by the [Bronokai theme VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=berikiushi0213.bronokai-theme)
